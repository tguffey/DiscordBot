**Grocery List Creator**

Bot creates a blank list of meals

You insert the name/ID of a meal you want to add
(Could contain http link to list of recipes)

Bot will show the list of meals you've added and you have the option to add more

After all meals are added you can also add extra staples like paper towels, coffee, etc.

At the end will display all ingredients in a single list you can check off. 

(Could possibly add feature to lookup recipe instructions based on name/ID)

**Grocery List "Database"**

Can use JSON fields to store recipes/data
